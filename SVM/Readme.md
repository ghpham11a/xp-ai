## Notes

SVMs shine with small to medium-sized nonlinear datasets (hundres to thousands of instances). Especially for classification

Regularization hyperparameter C determines how wide the support is. Increasing C makes support thinner.

SVMs are sensitive to feature scales. Be sure t use StandardScaler or equivalent
